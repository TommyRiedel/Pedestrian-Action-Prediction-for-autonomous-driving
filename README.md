"Camera-based Pedestrian Intention Detection for Autonomous Vehicles" (Master thesis at the FTM (TUM))

### Learnings:
 - PyTorch (lightning)
 - (Spatio-Temporal) Graph Convolutional Neural Networks
 - Tensorhub
 
## Motivation:

Pedestrians, categorized as Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs), contribute significantly to road accident fatalities, with over 90\% of incidents attributed to human error ([WHO](https://www.who.int/health-topics/road-safety#tab=tab_1)).
Increasing vehicle automation is seen as a potential solution to reduce accidents.
Autonomous vehicles rely on sensors like cameras, LiDAR, and radar to perceive their surroundings, enabling the prediction of road users' future behaviour for early response and accident prevention.
This thesis, conducted at the Chair of Automotive Technology (TUM), focuses on developing a model to predict the crossing behaviour of pedestrians, especially crucial given their high representation among VRUs and vulnerability during road crossing.
A potential first application could be in the research project ["EDGAR"](https://www.mos.ed.tum.de/ftm/forschungsfelder/team-av-perception/edgar/), in which an attempt is being made to create a fully autonomous Wiesn shuttle.
